The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.  When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.  And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.  Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.  When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, \u201CThis is one of the Hebrews\u2019 children.\u201D  Then his sister said to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, \u201CShall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\u201D  And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CGo.\u201D So the girl went and called the child\u2019s mother.  And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CTake this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.\u201D So the woman took the child and nursed him.  When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, \u201CBecause,\u201D she said, \u201CI drew him out of the water.\u201D  One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.  He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, \u201CWhy do you strike your companion?\u201D  He answered, \u201CWho made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201D Then Moses was afraid, and thought, \u201CSurely the thing is known.\u201D  When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father\u2019s flock.  The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.  When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, \u201CHow is it that you have come home so soon today?\u201D  They said, \u201CAn Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.\u201D  He said to his daughters, \u201CThen where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.\u201D  And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.  She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, \u201CI have been a sojourner in a foreign land.\u201D  During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  God saw the people of Israel\u2014and God knew."}

The woman conceived and bore a son, and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.  When she could hide him no longer, she took for him a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.  And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.  Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.  When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, \u201CThis is one of the Hebrews\u2019 children.\u201D  Then his sister said to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, \u201CShall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\u201D  And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CGo.\u201D So the girl went and called the child\u2019s mother.  And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CTake this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.\u201D So the woman took the child and nursed him.  When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, \u201CBecause,\u201D she said, \u201CI drew him out of the water.\u201D  One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.  He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, \u201CWhy do you strike your companion?\u201D  He answered, \u201CWho made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201D Then Moses was afraid, and thought, \u201CSurely the thing is known.\u201D  When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.  Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father\u2019s flock.  The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.  When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, \u201CHow is it that you have come home so soon today?\u201D  They said, \u201CAn Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.\u201D  He said to his daughters, \u201CThen where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.\u201D  And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah.  She gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, \u201CI have been a sojourner in a foreign land.\u201D  During those many days the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God.  And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  God saw the people of Israel\u2014and God knew."}

She put the child in it and placed it among the reeds by the river bank.  4 And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him.  5 Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her young women walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman, and she took it.  6 When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, \u201CThis is one of the Hebrews\u2019 children.\u201D  7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, \u201CShall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\u201D  8 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CGo.\u201D So the girl went and called the child\u2019s mother.  9 And Pharaoh\u2019s daughter said to her, \u201CTake this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.\u201D So the woman took the child and nursed him.  10 When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, \u201CBecause,\u201D she said, \u201CI drew him out of the water.\u201D  11 One day, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and looked on their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his people.  12 He looked this way and that, and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.  13 When he went out the next day, behold, two Hebrews were struggling together. And he said to the man in the wrong, \u201CWhy do you strike your companion?\u201D  14 He answered, \u201CWho made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\u201D Then Moses was afraid, and thought, \u201CSurely the thing is known.\u201D  15 When Pharaoh heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and stayed in the land of Midian. And he sat down by a well.  16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father\u2019s flock.  17 The shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and saved them, and watered their flock.  18 When they came home to their father Reuel, he said, \u201CHow is it that you have come home so soon today?\u201D  19 They said, \u201CAn Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.\u201D  20 He said to his daughters, \u201CThen where is he?

So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.\nThe Righteous Shall Live by Faith\n For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Claiming to be wise, they became fools,  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,  because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.

For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you  always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God\u2019s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.  For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you\u2014  that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u2019s faith, both yours and mine.  I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.  I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.  So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.\nThe Righteous Shall Live by Faith\n For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, \u201CThe righteous shall live by faith.\u201D\nGod\u2019s Wrath on Unrighteousness\n For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Claiming to be wise, they became fools,  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,  because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.

For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you  always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God\u2019s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.  For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you\u2014  that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u2019s faith, both yours and mine.  I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.  I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.  So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.\nThe Righteous Shall Live by Faith\n For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, \u201CThe righteous shall live by faith.\u201D\nGod\u2019s Wrath on Unrighteousness\n For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Claiming to be wise, they became fools,  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,  because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,  slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,  foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God\u2019s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."}

For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you  always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God\u2019s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.  For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you\u2014  that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other\u2019s faith, both yours and mine.  I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.  I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.  So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.\nThe Righteous Shall Live by Faith\n For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, \u201CThe righteous shall live by faith.\u201D\nGod\u2019s Wrath on Unrighteousness\n For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.  For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.  For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.  For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Claiming to be wise, they became fools,  and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.  Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,  because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;  and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.  And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,  slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,  foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God\u2019s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."}
